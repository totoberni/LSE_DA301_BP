# Assignment 5 scenario
## Turtle Games’s sales department has historically preferred to use R when performing 
## sales analyses due to existing workflow systems. As you’re able to perform data analysis 
## in R, you will perform exploratory data analysis and present your findings by utilising 
## basic statistics and plots. You'll explore and prepare the data set to analyse sales per 
## product. The sales department is hoping to use the findings of this exploratory analysis 
## to inform changes and improvements in the team. (Note that you will use basic summary 
## statistics in Module 5 and will continue to go into more detail with descriptive 
## statistics in Module 6.)

################################################################################

## Assignment 5 objective
## Load and wrangle the data. Use summary statistics and groupings if required to sense-check
## and gain insights into the data. Make sure to use different visualisations such as scatterplots, 
## histograms, and boxplots to learn more about the data set. Explore the data and comment on the 
## insights gained from your exploratory data analysis. For example, outliers, missing values, 
## and distribution of data. Also make sure to comment on initial patterns and distributions or 
## behaviour that may be of interest to the business.

# Module 5 assignment: Load, clean and wrangle data using R

## It is strongly advised that you use the cleaned version of the data set that you created and 
##  saved in the Python section of the course. Should you choose to redo the data cleaning in R, 
##  make sure to apply the same transformations as you will have to potentially compare the results.
##  (Note: Manual steps included dropping and renaming the columns as per the instructions in module 1.
##  Drop ‘language’ and ‘platform’ and rename ‘remuneration’ and ‘spending_score’) 

## 1. Open your RStudio and start setting up your R environment. 
## 2. Open a new R script and import the turtle_review.csv data file, which you can download from 
##      Assignment: Predicting future outcomes. (Note: You can use the clean version of the data 
##      you saved as csv in module 1, or, can manually drop and rename the columns as per the instructions 
##      in module 1. Drop ‘language’ and ‘platform’ and rename ‘remuneration’ and ‘spending_score’) 
## 3. Import all the required libraries for the analysis and view the data. 
## 4. Load and explore the data.
##    - View the head the data.
##    - Create a summary of the new data frame.
## 5. Perform exploratory data analysis by creating tables and visualisations to better understand 
##      groupings and different perspectives into customer behaviour and specifically how loyalty 
##      points are accumulated. Example questions could include:
##    - Can you comment on distributions, patterns or outliers based on the visual exploration of the data?
##    - Are there any insights based on the basic observations that may require further investigation?
##    - Are there any groupings that may be useful in gaining deeper insights into customer behaviour?
##    - Are there any specific patterns that you want to investigate
## 6. Create
##    - Create scatterplots, histograms, and boxplots to visually explore the loyalty_points data.
##    - Select appropriate visualisations to communicate relevant findings and insights to the business.
## 7. Note your observations and recommendations to the technical and business users.

# Assignment 6 scenario

## In Module 5, you were requested to redo components of the analysis using Turtle Games’s preferred 
## language, R, in order to make it easier for them to implement your analysis internally. As a final 
## task the team asked you to perform a statistical analysis and create a multiple linear regression 
## model using R to predict loyalty points using the available features in a multiple linear model. 
## They did not prescribe which features to use and you can therefore use insights from previous modules 
## as well as your statistical analysis to make recommendations regarding suitability of this model type,
## the specifics of the model you created and alternative solutions. As a final task they also requested 
## your observations and recommendations regarding the current loyalty programme and how this could be 
## improved. 

################################################################################

## Assignment 6 objective
## You need to investigate customer behaviour and the effectiveness of the current loyalty program based 
## on the work completed in modules 1-5 as well as the statistical analysis and modelling efforts of module 6.
##  - Can we predict loyalty points given the existing features using a relatively simple MLR model?
##  - Do you have confidence in the model results (Goodness of fit evaluation)
##  - Where should the business focus their marketing efforts?
##  - How could the loyalty program be improved?
##  - How could the analysis be improved?

################################################################################

## Assignment 6 assignment: Making recommendations to the business.

## 1. Continue with your R script in RStudio from Assignment Activity 5: Cleaning, manipulating, and 
##     visualising the data.
## 2. Load and explore the data, and continue to use the data frame you prepared in Module 5.
## 3. Perform a statistical analysis and comment on the descriptive statistics in the context of the 
##     review of how customers accumulate loyalty points.
##  - Comment on distributions and patterns observed in the data.
##  - Determine and justify the features to be used in a multiple linear regression model and potential
##.    concerns and corrective actions.
## 4. Create a Multiple linear regression model using your selected (numeric) features.
##  - Evaluate the goodness of fit and interpret the model summary statistics.
##  - Create a visual demonstration of the model
##  - Comment on the usefulness of the model, potential improvements and alternate suggestions that could 
##     be considered.
##  - Demonstrate how the model could be used to predict given specific scenarios. (You can create your own 
##     scenarios).
## 5. Perform exploratory data analysis by using statistical analysis methods and comment on the descriptive 
##     statistics in the context of the review of how customers accumulate loyalty points.
## 6. Document your observations, interpretations, and suggestions based on each of the models created in 
##     your notebook. (This will serve as input to your summary and final submission at the end of the course.)
