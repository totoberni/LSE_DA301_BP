1. Read the Data Analysis coursework scenario: 
```plaintext
You are part of a team of data analysts that was contracted by Turtle Games, a game manufacturer and retailer with a global customer base. The company manufactures and sells its own products, along with sourcing and selling products manufactured by other companies. Its product range includes books, board games, video games, and toys. The company collects data from sales and customer reviews. Turtle Games has a business objective of improving overall sales performance by analysing and considering customer trends.  

To improve overall sales performance, Turtle Games has developed an initial set of questions. You’ll explore these questions in greater depth through the weekly assignment activities. The questions are: 

How do customers engage with and accumulate loyalty points?
How can customers be segmented into groups, and which groups can be targeted by the marketing department? 
How can text data (e.g. social data such as customer reviews) be used to inform marketing campaigns and make improvements to the business?
Can we use descriptive statistics to provide insights into the suitability of the loyalty points data to create predictive models (e.g. normal distribution, skewness, or kurtosis) to justify the answer.)
To support your team of data analysts, you’ll:

Create a Jupyter Notebook (IPYNB) and R script (R): You’ll analyse the data and prepare a complete Jupyter Notebook and R script that includes key metrics to inform decision-making (e.g. visualisations, comments, and thought processes). Remember to follow good practices in documenting your code intentions and noting your observations and interpretations.

Week

Assignment activity

1

Make predictions with regression.

You’ll apply linear regression techniques to determine how customers accumulate loyalty points.

For the final Jupyter Notebook, you should indicate your process of importing the relevant data set with the Pandas library, and storing the data in a DataFrame. You’ll also need to create, fit, and determine the accuracy of a regression model. 
For the final report, you’ll provide a summary of the process you followed to create, fit, and improve the accuracy of the regression model.
For the final presentation, you’ll discuss your observations and interpretation of the results of using the modelling techniques applied in your analysis of loyalty points.
2

Explore data with decision trees.

You’ll create a decision tree regressor to gain insights into how customers accumulate loyalty points. 

For the final Jupyter Notebook, you should:
indicate your process of importing the necessary libraries and preparing the data for the decision tree
grow and prune the tree 
interpret the tree using appropriate visualisations. 
For the final report, you’ll provide a summary of the process you followed to create, fit, and prune the decision tree.
For the final presentation, you’ll provide a high-level overview of the insights gained during your process and how this could be used in improving the program, or in marketing efforts.
3

Make predictions with clustering.

You’ll apply k-means clustering to segment customers into groups (based on remuneration and spending scores) that can be targeted by the marketing team. 

For the final Jupyter Notebook, you should indicate your process of importing the necessary libraries and preparing the data for clustering. You’ll also need to create, fit, and determine the accuracy of a clustering model. 
For the final report, you’ll provide a summary of the process you followed to create, fit, and improve the accuracy of the clustering model.
For the final presentation, you’ll provide a high-level overview of the process you followed, indicate what you observed, and explain how the results can be used to improve marketing efforts.
4

Analyse customer sentiments observed in reviews.

You’ll apply natural language processing (NLP) to determine how social data (e.g. customer reviews) can be used to inform marketing campaigns and business operations.

For the final Jupyter Notebook, you should indicate your process of importing the relevant data set with the Pandas library, and storing the data in a DataFrame. You’ll also need to demonstrate the process you followed to perform NLP.
For the final report, you’ll provide a summary of the process you followed to identify the 15 most common words and top 20 positive and negative reviews used in online product reviews.
For the final presentation, you’ll provide a high-level description of the process you followed, indicate what you observed, and explain how identifying popular terms, sentiment, and specific keywords can be used to improve marketing decisions based on your NLP analysis.
5

Clean and wrangle data and perform EDA in R.

You’ll load and wrangle the data, and use basic visualisation techniques during exploratory data analysis (EDA). You’ll also use visual techniques to communicate your basic findings.

For the final R script, you’ll demonstrate your ability to load, wrangle, and explore the data visually using R. The script should contain the relevant code for the visualisations used in the technical and business submissions.
For the final report, you need to explain your process and rationale behind the loading, cleaning, and wrangling, as well as the insights gained from applying visualisation techniques to perform exploratory data analysis and how the selected visualisations can create value for the organisation.
For the final presentation, you’ll provide basic observations and insights based on the visual exploratory analysis of the data.
6

Make recommendations to the business.

You’ll apply descriptive statistics and modelling techniques to create models that can be used to inform business decisions. This section will build on previous sections where you’ll need to decide which features to include and the appropriate model for the intended purpose. You can include observations regarding the evolution of your analysis and how you improved and refined the insights and recommendations provided to the business.

For the final R script, you should indicate your process of answering the questions by applying descriptive statistical and modelling techniques and by crreating appropriate visualisations to communicate insights and model predictions.
For the final report, you’ll comment on the descriptive statistical characteristics of the data set, the process of identifying and selecting appropriate features to use, and the modelling techniques applied. You’ll also comment on the model's performance and how this could be used to respond to the questions posed by Turtle games. You can also share any obstacles you faced in the process and how you overcame them.
For the final presentation, you’ll briefly describe the process you followed and the insights gained at various stages of the project and how this impacted the choices made in terms of creating models that the business can use. Indicate what you observed, and explain your insights and recommendations to Turtle Games. Make sure to provide a rationale regarding how your analysis can support specific recommendations for actions to be implemented in the business. You can also suggest further questions to explore.
Completing your Jupyter Notebook and R script
Ensure that your code and outputs in your Jupyter Notebook and R script leverage best practices related to data ingestion, wrangling, visual design principles, documentation (comments and observations), making predictions, and reproducibility of code. Use the Jupyter Notebook template and R script file templates provided in the ZIP file you downloaded, along with the data.

The suggested approach for your analysis is as follows:
Data ingestion, wrangling, and predictive modelling: Utilise an accurate set of functions, variables, parameters, and attributes to import the data files, wrangle the data, and build predictive models leveraging various prediction algorithms with Python and R. 
When importing, make sure you import the correct files in the appropriate format. 
When wrangling, make sure to transform your data into a format that comprises consistent values, uses appropriate data types, and has no missing values. 
When building models, ensure that you utilise the correct Python and R libraries, and give your function and variables names that are intuitive and descriptive.
Ensure that you provide detailed and insightful descriptions of code and outputs at each stage in your Jupyter Notebook (using the text markdown feature) and R script (using R comments).
Visualisation and predictions: Ensure that the created visualisations display your findings and communicate trends related to Turtle Games’s objectives.
When plotting charts, follow the basic visual design principles concerning chart type, colour, size, resolution, and layout.
When plotting charts, include extra context and information around the visualisations, such as why you chose the particular visualisation to convey the result and how the audience should interpret the output.
Explain the code you used to prepare the visualisations as well as the interpretation of the outputs at each stage in your Jupyter Notebook and R script. 
Jupyter Notebook and R script: Organise a clean, easy-to-understand, and structured Notebook that has a logical flow that communicates your end-to-end analysis. Ensure your code and outputs have corresponding descriptions so that the reader understands what each of the components in the Jupyter Notebook and the R script means, or is meant to do. Make sure the code lines in the Notebook have sequential numbering so that the readers can interpret the workflow and logic. (Hint: For Jupyter Notebooks, you may restart the kernel, run the code, and review the outputs before moving on to submitting your work.)
Ensure that you use the correct naming convention before you submit. Save and submit your files as: 
LastName_FirstName_DA301_Assignment_Notebook.ipynb 
LastName_FirstName_DA301_Assignment_Rscript.R
```
