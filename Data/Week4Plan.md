# Strategic Plan: Product Intelligence via Advanced NLP

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines a strategic plan to transform the Week 4 NLP analysis from a descriptive exercise into a proactive **Product Intelligence Engine**. Building on the insight that customer sentiment is a key differentiator for high-value customers, we will pivot from customer analysis to product analysis. The objective is to use a suite of advanced NLP techniques to understand *which* products are driving positive and negative feedback, *why* they are succeeding or failing, and *what* emerging trends exist across the entire product catalog.

This plan is structured in three phases to deliver increasingly granular and strategic insights:
1.  **Product Sentiment Baseline:** We will first aggregate sentiment scores on a per-product basis to identify the best- and worst-performing products, providing immediate, actionable data.
2.  **Granular Diagnostics with ABSA:** We will implement Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) to move beyond a simple "good/bad" score and understand customer sentiment towards specific product features like `Component Quality` and `Rulebook Clarity`.
3.  **Strategic Trend-Spotting with Topic Modeling:** We will use Topic Modeling to discover hidden themes and trends within the entire corpus of customer reviews, creating an early-warning system for product opportunities and threats.

This approach will provide Turtle Games with a deep, multi-faceted understanding of its product landscape, directly informing product development, marketing, and quality assurance.

## 2. Advanced Implementation Plan

Our primary goal is to use NLP to segment and analyze products, thereby uncovering the root causes of customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction. We will use the fully-featured `rdf8` DataFrame, which contains our accurately engineered sentiment scores.

### 2.1. Phase 1: Product Sentiment Baseline & Triage

This phase establishes a high-level overview of product performance, allowing the business to immediately identify top performers and products in need of attention.

**a. Aggregate Sentiment by Product:**
   - Group the dataset by `product`.
   - For each product, calculate the **average `review_sentiment_score`** and the **total number of reviews**.

**b. Identify "Best" and "Worst" Products:**
   - Filter for products with a statistically significant number of reviews (e.g., more than 5) to ensure our findings are robust.
   - Generate two presentation-ready bar charts:
     1.  **Top 10 "Most Loved" Products:** The 10 products with the highest average sentiment.
     2.  **Top 10 "Most Divisive" Products:** The 10 products with the lowest average sentiment.
   - **Business Value:** This provides an immediate, data-driven list for the marketing team (to promote the "loved" products) and the product team (to investigate the "divisive" ones).

**c. Generate Diagnostic Word Clouds:**
   - For the #1 "Most Loved" and #1 "Most Divisive" product, generate word clouds from their respective reviews. This will provide a quick, intuitive visual summary of the key terms associated with their success or failure.

### 2.2. Phase 2: Granular Diagnostics with Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)

This is the most impactful phase, moving from a general sentiment score to a precise diagnostic tool.

**a. Define Key Business Aspects:**
   - We will define a dictionary of key product aspects relevant to Turtle Games.
   - **Example Aspects & Keywords:**
     - `Component Quality`: ['pieces', 'cards', 'miniatures', 'quality', 'plastic', 'cardboard']
     - `Rulebook Clarity`: ['rules', 'instructions', 'confusing', 'easy to learn', 'manual']
     - `Art & Design`: ['art', 'beautiful', 'design', 'illustration', 'style']
     - `Gameplay Fun`: ['fun', 'boring', 'exciting', 'gameplay', 'mechanics']
     - `Value for Money`: ['price', 'cheap', 'expensive', 'value', 'worth']

**b. Implement a Keyword-Based ABSA:**
   - For the "Most Divisive" products identified in Phase 1, we will iterate through their reviews.
   - For each review, we will search for our predefined keywords.
   - When a keyword is found, we will extract the sentence containing it and calculate its sentiment score using a fine-tuned model like **VADER** (as it excels at social media/review text).

**c. Visualize the Aspect-Level Feedback:**
   - For each investigated product, generate a horizontal bar chart that shows the average sentiment for each aspect.
   - **Business Value:** This creates a product-specific "report card." A product manager could see at a glance that their game is failing not because the gameplay is bad (`Gameplay Fun: +0.7`), but because the `Rulebook Clarity` is a disaster (`-0.8`). This is a precise, actionable insight that can directly guide a product revision.

### 2.3. Phase 3: Strategic Trend-Spotting with Topic Modeling

This final phase zooms out to analyze the entire review corpus, identifying strategic themes that cut across multiple products.

**a. Pre-process Text for Topic Modeling:**
   - We will apply standard NLP pre-processing to the entire `review` corpus: tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization to prepare the text for analysis.

**b. Implement Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA):**
   - Train an LDA model on the processed text to automatically discover a predefined number of hidden "topics" or themes.
   - We will determine the optimal number of topics using the coherence score.

**c. Visualize and Interpret Topics:**
   - For each discovered topic, we will visualize the top 15 most representative words. This allows us to interpret and assign a business-relevant name to each topic.
   - **Example Topics:**
     - **Topic 1 (Family Game Night):** `['family', 'kids', 'fun', 'easy', 'laugh', 'party']`
     - **Topic 2 (Component Issues):** `['box', 'pieces', 'missing', 'broken', 'damaged', 'quality']`
     - **Topic 3 (Complex Strategy):** `['strategy', 'rules', 'difficult', 'think', 'challenging']`

**d. Link Topics to Business Outcomes:**
   - The final, most powerful step is to calculate the **average `CustomerValueScore` for all customers who reviewed products associated with each topic**.
   - **Business Value:** This provides unparalleled strategic insight. The business might discover that products in the "Family Game Night" topic are associated with a consistently high `CustomerValueScore`, justifying further investment in that product line. Conversely, they might find that the "Component Issues" topic is strongly linked to a low `CustomerValueScore`, providing a clear, data-driven mandate to invest in quality assurance and operational improvements.
