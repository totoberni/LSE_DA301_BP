# LSE DA301: Advanced Analytics - Turtle Games Project

This repository contains the coursework for the LSE Data Analytics Career Accelerator course DA301. The project involves a comprehensive analysis of the Turtle Games dataset to derive business insights on customer loyalty, segmentation, and sentiment. The analysis is conducted using both Python for machine learning tasks and R for statistical modeling and visualization.

## Repository Structure

The project is organized into separate directories for data, Python notebooks, R scripts, and final reports.

## Environment Setup

To ensure full reproducibility of the analysis, please follow the setup instructions below.

### Python Environment

The Python analysis is managed within a dedicated virtual environment.

1.  **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd LSE_DA301_BP
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Python directory**:

    ```bash
    cd Python
    ```

3.  **Create a virtual environment**:

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

4.  **Activate the environment**:

      * On **macOS/Linux**:
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
      * On **Windows**:
        ```powershell
        .\.venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

5.  **Install the required dependencies**: With the environment activated, install all necessary libraries from the `requirements.txt` file.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6.  **Register the environment as a Jupyter Kernel**: This step makes your virtual environment available within Jupyter, ensuring your notebook uses the correct packages.

    ```bash
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name=lse-da301-project
    ```

7.  **Launch Jupyter and Run the Notebook**:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    Once Jupyter opens, open the `Berni_Alberto_DA301_Assignment_Notebook.ipynb` file. When the notebook is open, go to `Kernel > Change kernel` and select **`lse-da301-project`** to connect the notebook to your new environment.
